# hangman
This project's purpose is to create [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) using Ruby and serialization techniques.
My serialization method of choice is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

The basic implementation of Hangman was very similar to the basic game loop of my previous project [Mastermind](https://github.com/thislsnotmyname/mastermind), so that part was fairly simple. The basic serialization was also fairly simple. Implementing it correctly, on the other hand, took some doing. The hardest part, by far, was creating a menu and command system to save and load the data.

This project was made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman).
